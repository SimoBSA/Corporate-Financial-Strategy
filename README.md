**Project Overview**

Many businesses, particularly SMEs and startups, accumulate surplus capital but lack a systematic approach to allocate it effectively. Studies indicate that excessive debt negatively impacts profitability, and a significant number of firms retain earnings without a strategic plan of use. Poor capital allocation decisions have led to under performance in companies with substantial resources. These challenges underscore the need for a data-driven model to guide optimal capital allocation decisions.‚Äù

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm that recommends optimal capital allocation, specifically: debt repayment or expansion investment, or RnD investment, based on financial performance indicators such as: price to earnings and debt to equity ratios, return on investments (ROI) and revenue growth.
